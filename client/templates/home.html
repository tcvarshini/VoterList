       The voter's list (officially known as the electoral roll) is a compiled comprehensive list, which includes the names and other details of voters in a particular constituency.However, this has to be done at least 10 days before the elections so that any type of error can be fixed at the earliest. Once the elections are about to begin, alterations are not allowed.The updated list ensures that the names of new voters (citizens who have reached 18 years) are added and the names of deceased individuals are removed.The updated list confirms that there arenâ€™t any fake votes under the names of deceased individuals.
